the html file labeled "workshop" is where my workshop block 10 picasso painting project will be found. the css stylesheet is only linked to that project.
The basic fundamentals of this project I somewhat understand, but as far as fitting the page to different screen sizes, I still need to work on and do some more research on how that works, because I really am just unsure at this time on how to appy that.
The only other thing I felt like I was confused on was the z index. I could not get it to do anything no matter what I tried, so I will have to do some more work on that as well.
